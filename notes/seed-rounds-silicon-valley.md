* What differentiates a company that can raise Series A from one that can't is the company's ability to prove the product has reached _product-market fit_: &ldquo;what the startup offers can be sold, and users keep using and paying for it&rdquo;.
* _Product-market fit_ involves **recurring revenue** and **customer retention**.
* In 2020, 82% of startups that raise a Series A have good revenues.
* In Silicon Valley nowadays, the seed round is a phase (usually more than one fundraising round), not a single round.
* The secret is to _start building the easiest product possible._
* Becoming a thoughtful observer of how Silicon Valley evolves over time is one of the most important things to learn.
    * The enterprise market moves most of the business in Silicon Valley (currently).
* If you want investment, share your numbers and ask for money. 
* If you want product feedback, **cold email potential users and founders** who have tried and failed to solve a similar problem in the past.
