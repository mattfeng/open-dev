# The history, status, and future of FPGAs ([http](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3411759), [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPDH7YmRUFrLnxc9ahSJfEAoEog4s3tAQznaAy2wjtrba))

* Intel, AMD, and other chip companies use FPGAs to emulate their chips before manufacturing them.
* Huawei is the largest customer for FPGAs.
* In HPC and datacenter usage of FPGAs today, the main obstacle is _place and route_ &mdash; running the proprietary FPGA vendor software to map the circuit onto the FPGA elements can take up to three days.
* The FPGA opportunity in oil and gas simulations still exists, though is currently dominated by CPUs and GPUs.
* Many developers prefer GPUs because they are available in the cloud, which is used for simulation and testing. FPGAs need to make it to the cloud for them to be adopted.


## Key players
* Xilinx
* Altera
