# Mental frameworks

* Don't think about _if_ something will happen; think about _when_ it will happen, and what will be its consequences.
* Be open minded. If something fails, you lose 1x. If it works, you can gain 1000x or more.

## Communication structures
* Communication structures provide a framework for engaging in effective social interactions.
* _"What/So what/Now what?"_
  * What is my point?
  * How does my point affect my audience?
  * What actions should we take now?
