# Mental frameworks

* Don't think about _if_ something will happen; think about _when_ it will happen, and what will be its consequences.
* Be open minded. If something fails, you lose 1x. If it works, you can gain 1000x or more.
* Beware the false negative. False negatives can lead to lost opportunities (they don't self correct).

## Communication structures
* Communication structures provide a framework for engaging in effective social interactions.
* _"What/So what/Now what?"_
  * What is my point?
  * How does my point affect my audience?
  * What actions should we take now?

## Systems
* Great leaders are people who understand that it is not their job to know the future. It is their job to create a system that discovers that future.
* Don't try to connect the dots (game out all the possible outcomes of an action).
