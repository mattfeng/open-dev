# Michael Seibel, How to Plan an MVP (Startup School 2019)

* **(Definition) MVP.** The _first thing_ you can give to the _first set_ of users to see if you can deliver _any value at all_.

* Goal of a pre-launch startup
    * Launch quickly (MVP)
    * Get initial customers
    * Talk to customers, and get feedback
    * Iterate
* Lean MVP (most cases)
    * Weeks of building, not months
    * Minimal functionality
    * Appeal to small set of users
    * Base to iterate from
* Launch simply means getting customers
* Hacks
    * Time box your spec (give 3 weeks)
    * Write down your spec
    * Cut your spec
    * Don't fall in love with your MVP
