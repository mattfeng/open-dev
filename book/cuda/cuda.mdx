# CUDA Programming Cheatsheet

## Definitions
* A **thread**
* A **block**
* A **warp**
* A **grid**
* The **device** is the GPU (accelerator).
* The **host** is the CPU.

Set the number of blocks from ``N/TPB`` to ``(N + TPB - 1)/TPB`` to ensure that the number of blocks is rounded up (which will guarantee that no index is left uncomputed).

## Reductions
