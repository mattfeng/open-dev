## What is `systemd`?

The `systemd` init system is a powerful suite of software that can manage many aspects of a server, such as services and mounted devices.[^1]

## Concepts

A **unit** is any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. It is the primary object that `systemd` tools work with. They are defined using configuration files called **unit files.**

Units are similar to services in other init systems, but are more general and organized by function, allowing for greater composability. (TODO: give concrete example)
