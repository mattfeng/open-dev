## What is `systemd`?

The `systemd` init system is a powerful suite of software that can manage many aspects of a server, such as services and mounted devices.[^1]

## Concepts

A **unit** is any resource that the system knows how to operate on and manage. It is the primary object that `systemd` tools work with. They are defined using configuration files called **unit files.**

Units extend beyond services. Rather, they are centered around functionality, enabling greater composability through more effective abstractions. Examples of units include network resources, devices, filesystem mounts, and services.

The unit files are generally stored in ``/lib/systemd/system``.

### Types of units
