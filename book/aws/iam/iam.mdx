## Users, Roles, and Policies[^1]

**IAM Users** and **IAM Roles** are types of _identities_ (also known as **IAM Principals**); they provide _authentication_.

**IAM Policies** provide _authorization_: they give the IAM Principals permission to perform certain actions.

An **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** uniquely identifies any resource (i.e. any object) within AWS.

## Writing IAM Policies
The comprehensive list of all _actions_, _resources_, and _conditions_ keys for IAM Policies can be found in the documentation[^2].
