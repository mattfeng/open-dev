## What is a _data warehouse_?

A **data warehouse** is a system that pulls together data from many different sources within an organization, often for reporting and analysis.[^1] It does not store current information, nor is it updated in real-time. Rather, they store historical data, often enabling longitudinal data analysis (that is, analysis over time).

Data warehouses process data via OLAP (online analytical processing) as opposed to OLTP (online transaction processing) in order to speed up analysis.

Data in data warehouses is often **denormalized** to speed up queries and data analysis.

Generally, data warehouses support a limited number of concurrent users.
